# Blackout

Simple rust based application to black out my monitors with a command.

Planning to support inputting a duratio, and specifying which moitors through
cli arguments.

No plans to make useful for others just exists to give myself a more cinematic
experience watching stuff, and as a way to learn x11rb for a harder project to
come.
